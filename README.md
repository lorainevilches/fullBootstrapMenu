# fullBootstrapMenu
jQuery function for Horizontal Bootstrap Menu 100% dynamic

This is a function to dynamically implement a Bootsrap menu where it organizes itself horizontally to occupy the full size of the container.

It was separated into 2 files for the explanation to be more organized.

The menu was built with Bootstrap's default structure, using the 'NAV' class and a list to create it horizontally.

With the function, just place the menu items to each item in the list, and automatically it will calculate so that the items occupy 100% of the entire size of the container.
